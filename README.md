# 🐟 Fish's First C Project

My first repository on GitHub!

A collection of my early C programming exercises and experiments.

## 📁 Projects

- **`first_test/`**  
  My very first C program — a simple "Hello, World!" style test.

  Practice code following tutorials from [imooc](https://www.imooc.com/) (a Chinese learning platform).

## ▶️ How to Compile
In any project folder:
```bash
gcc *.c -o program
./program
```

💡 This repo is for learning Git, GitHub, and C programming fundamentals.

## 🧠Some thoughts
- Actually im just a freshman,and not good at English..
- To have my first repository ,it dose cost me a lot time,but finally i make it,and i certain it's worthful.yeah yeah yeah!
- I don't know what will happend later...in the future.
- But it's a GOOD start for me.
- Remind myself:
  -“My dream is to create my own indie game.”
